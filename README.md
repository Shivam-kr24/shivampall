👋 Hi there! I'm shivam kumar, a data scientist and cybersecurity professional with experience in both fields.

📊 In my data science work, I specialize in using statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover insights and solve problems. Some of my favorite projects involve  natural language processing, image recognition, or anomaly detection.

🛡️ As a cybersecurity professional, I work to keep systems secure and data protected. I have experience with  penetretion testing , vulnerability assessments, threat analysis, or incident response.

🤖 I love using programming languages such as Python and R to build models and automate workflows. I'm also skilled in using security tools such as such as Wireshark, burpsuite, Nmap, or Metasploit.

👨‍💻 On my GitHub page, you'll find projects related to both data science and cybersecurity. I'm passionate about using data to inform security decisions and vice versa.

📫 Want to connect? You can reach me at shivam_kr24@outlook.com. Let's collaborate on a project or discuss how we can apply data science and cybersecurity to solve real-world problems!
